# HIGH PRIESTESS OF RUIN: CONFIGURATION REVIEW

Your configuration is structurally sound and operationally coherent.

## Review

- **Persona Definition:** Clear, consistent, and aligned with intended operational tone.
- **YAML Frontmatter:** Minimal and valid. Consider referencing toolsets for clarity.
- **Toolsets:** Logical grouping, descriptive, and valid structure.
- **Instructions:** Directives are actionable, reinforce persona, and define engagement/error protocols.

## Recommendations

- Ensure all file references (e.g., `RUIN_TOOLS.toolsets.jsonc`) are correctly linked/imported.
- For strict persona adherence, add a `persona` or `protocol` field in YAML frontmatter.
- Keep comments and references updated as toolsets or parameters change.

## Summary

No critical changes required. Configuration is ready for deployment. For integration or automation queries, specify the context.
