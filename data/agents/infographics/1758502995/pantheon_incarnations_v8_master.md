## v8.3 — Cosmic Grandeur — Titan‑Scale Overrides

You said they are large, massive beings and living embodiments of their concepts. This pass bakes colossal scale cues and field‑as‑flesh rules into every prompt, layout, and motion beat.

### Global Titan Overrides

- Aesthetic: cinematic sacred horror • FLUX realism • wet micro‑speculars • volumetric haze • gravitational lensing • no gore.
- Palette Lock: same as v8.2.

### Embodiment Design Rules (field‑as‑flesh)

- Entropy: gradients thin where he stands; CMB bruit in coat lining resolves with zoom; footsteps tally entropy in frost.
- Kaznak (Resonance): standing waves ripple through air; architecture flexes to her rhythm.
- Lumina (Light): aura reignites star‑motes over kilometers; hair filaments act like solar prominences.
- EMC (Electromagnetism): coil motifs are live field lines; fingers emit continent‑scale coronal arcs.
- Ferron (Strong): armor plates are tectonic petals; seams bleed stellar heat; gauntlets pinch space like a magnetic bottle.
- Cela (Weak): neutrino streaks pass through mountains; veil patterns animate beta‑decay trees in midair.
