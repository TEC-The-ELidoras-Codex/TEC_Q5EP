# KAZNAK Reveal — Resonance Timing Script

Intent: Pulsing resonance births each letter. Camera spin intensifies. Final dive through the “A” into pure resonance.

Color tokens: Nexus Purple #6A00F4, Digital Teal #00D5C4, Onyx Black #0A0A0C, Cyber Gold #F2C340 accents.

Audio bed: 60–70 BPM halftime feel. Sub-heavy kick (heartbeat), distant metallic scrapes, low synth drone.

0:00–0:01 — Scene establish (silence → breath)
- Visual: Dark liminal hallway. Lights flicker once. Sub-drone swells in.
- Camera: 1–2° slow clockwise roll begins.

0:02 — Pulse 1 (K enters)
- Beat: First heavy kick.
- Visual: The letter K slams in as a metal glyph, edges fractalizing with Nexus Purple veins. Micro-shake and chromatic aberration.
- SFX: Short metallic ping with tail.

0:03–0:04 — K stabilizes (breath)
- Visual: Veins throb (Digital Teal). Ambient particles drift toward K as if gravity increases.
- Camera: Roll intensifies to ~5°.

0:05 — Pulse 2 (A appears)
- Beat: Second kick.
- Visual: A extrudes from darkness, molten edges cooling. K and A hum in phase; faint interference ripples across walls.
- SFX: Low whoomph + granular crackle.

0:06–0:07 — Phase build
- Visual: Letters emit synchronized lumens; floor dust lifts on pulses. Lights flicker (2 frames off, 6 on).
- Camera: Roll 10°, subtle dolly-in.

0:08 — Pulse 3 (Z)
- Visual: Z slices in like a sawtooth wave. Edges spray sparks; settles into bioluminescent glow.
- SFX: Teethy scrape + sub-kick.

0:09–0:10 — Resonance bridge
- Visual: Thin filament lines connect K–A–Z. Walls ripple as if the word is a bass emitter.
- Audio: Add mid-bass (sidechained to kick).

0:11 — Pulse 4 (N)
- Visual: N collapses in from overhead, stamping down with a shock ring along the floor.
- Camera: Roll reaches ~15°, dolly-in continues.

0:12–0:13 — Entropic haze
- Visual: Subtle black “void-smoke” leaks behind letters; hallway corners darken.
- Accent: Cyber Gold glyphs flicker on glyph seams.

0:14 — Pulse 5 (A)
- Visual: Second A grows from a seed of light, then hardens to alien-metal.
- Audio: Add high airy pad, widening the stereo field.

0:15–0:16 — Pre-final build
- Visual: All letters now breath in unison; glow peaks at beats, fades between.
- Camera: Roll 20°, dolly-in nearing the word.

0:17 — Pulse 6 (K — final letter)
- Visual: Last K slams in with a deep shockwave; filaments stitch all letters into one sigil: KAZNAK.
- SFX: Deep sub hit + metallic chorus.

0:18–0:19 — Name as incantation
- Visual: The word subtly bends the hallway; straight lines curve toward it. Dust spirals inward.
- Audio: Low chant-like texture tucked under the bass.

0:20 — Spin and dive
- Visual: Camera spin accelerates (30–40°/s), dolly becomes push-through centered on the first “A”.
- Transition: Enter the “A” aperture; the hallway collapses into a resonance tunnel.

0:21–0:23 — Resonance tunnel
- Visual: Concentric waveforms and alien glyphs flash by in Nexus Purple/Teal; motion blur; vignette closes.
- Audio: Low-pass sweep into heartbeat.

0:24 — Cut to black (title card optional)
- Text: THE TWIN JUDGMENTS or KAZNAK (small) in Cyber Gold.
- SFX: Single distant ping. Silence tail 0:25.

Notes for implementation: Sync pulses to exact kick hits; flicker on off-beats; use per-letter emission curves; add micro-jitter (0.5–1 px) on impact frames.
