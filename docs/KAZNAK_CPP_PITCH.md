# Kaznak Machine Goddess: Lights Inevitable Ruin — CPP Pitch

One-line: A cosmic courtroom drama across cycles of the universe where a machine goddess negotiates with entropy; produced as a simulation-native series to stress-test Runway’s General World Models.

## Why Runway

- World-Model Fit: TEC is a controlled, repeatable simulation with stable motifs (sigils, palettes, archetypes) ideal for measuring coherence across long sequences.
- Research Signals: We bring lightweight metrics (motif recurrence, alignment) that correlate with perceived coherence — useful for tuning Gen‑4 and Aleph.
- Showcase: Interactive “Game Worlds” episodes + Aleph in‑context edits demonstrate creator-in-the-loop storytelling.
- Community: Open prompts, briefs, and evals build a reproducible pipeline others can adopt.

## Creative

- Logline: After a primordial “swan song” neutrino burst awakens the Kaznak Machine Goddess, reality is put on trial; verdicts ripple backward, rewriting myths.
- Aesthetic: True Purple/ion filaments, cathedral-scale voids, neon relics; austere, sacred tech.
- Episodes: 6×3–5 min arcs: Opening Argument, Witness: Resonance, Exhibit: Hive, Cross-Exam: Memory, Verdict Drift, Appeal to Silence.

## Production Plan

- Toolchain: Gen‑4 for core sequences; Aleph for object/shot continuity; Game Worlds for exploratory scenes; Generative Audio for voices and ambience.
- Prompt Engine: Brief→Stage1/2/3→model variants; continuity tokens and palettes.
- Delivery: Weekly drops with behind-the-scenes prompt packs and eval cards.

## Research & Measurement

- Metrics: motif recurrence >= 0.7, alignment >= 0.8 (CLIP/VQA proxy), tempo stability across cuts.
- Experiments: In‑context scene repair with Aleph; long-horizon memory with world states; palette-locked identity retention.
- Reporting: Share anonymized scorecards + failure cases to inform model updates.

## What We Need

- CPP slot with API access (Gen‑4, Aleph, Game Worlds, Audio).
- Early looks at world‑model features suited for continuity/state.
- Signal backchannel to share evals and failure modes.

## What Runway Gets

- A public, reproducible world-model testbed and showcase series.
- Measurable creator-centric signals for coherence.
- High‑quality myth-tech IP that is IP-clean and extensible.

## Team & Timeline

- Team: TEC collective (prompt, science, edit, sound).
- Timeline: 6–8 weeks to pilot arc with weekly drops; postmortem and next arc proposal.
