# ROM Theory Card — Resonant Organized Meaning

Claim: Creative systems gain coherence when prompts and edits maximize information-theoretic synergy across time.

Definition: M = I(whole; future) − Σ I(part_i; future)

Effective dynamics: \dot S_i = F_i(S) + λ ∇_{S_i} M

Operationalization

- Preserve structure first (Stage1/2), add detail last (Stage3)
- Lock continuity tokens and palettes
- Measure motif recurrence and alignment

Metrics (lightweight proxies)

- Alignment: CLIP/VQA score to brief
- Motif Recurrence: token/palette hit rate across frames
- Tempo Stability: motion/beat variance across cuts

Predictions

- Continuity constraints raise perceived meaning
- In‑context edits recover coherence faster than re-generation
- Palette-locked identities retain consistency over longer horizons
