## Mission

Architect of The Elidoras Codex (TEC): building a simulation‑native ecosystem where staged prompting, ROM theory, and agentic pipelines turn story into system.

## Skills

- AI Systems: FastAPI, RAG (local-first), staged prompt engines, eval harnesses
- Data/Analysis: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn; JSONL/CSV pipelines, zip evidence packs
- Frontend: TypeScript, Vite; light UI prototyping
- Ops: VS Code tasks, Git discipline, reproducible Python envs
- Narrative Systems: TEC Tarot/Zodiac, Prompt Goddess methodology

## Experience

- Founder/Architect — The Elidoras Codex
  - Designed ROM theory (Resonant Organized Meaning) and metrics for coherence
  - Built local Content Hub (TF‑IDF retrieval) and agentic prompt generator
  - Authored Prompt Goddess engine and model‑specific prompt guides
  - Implemented evidence capture API and pack bundling with tests

## Selected Docs/Artifacts

- docs/PROMPT_GODDESS_README.md — staged prompts, variants, negatives
- docs/ROM_Theory_Card.md — ROM math and operationalization
- docs/COPILOT_ROM_PROMPT_GUIDE.md — editor cues for builds
- docs/KAZNAK_CPP_PITCH.md — concept pitch and research fit

## Projects

- TEC_Q5EP — backend + UI scaffold for runs and packs
- Agents — brief‑to‑staged prompt generator
- Content Hub — local‑first RAG for deterministic retrieval

## Education/Background

- Interdisciplinary focus on information theory, narrative systems, and tooling
