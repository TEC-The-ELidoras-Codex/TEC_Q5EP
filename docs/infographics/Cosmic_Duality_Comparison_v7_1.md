# ReTEC Infographic Prompt: Cosmic Duality Comparison (V7.1)

Objective: Create a two-panel, side-by-side infographic comparing core entities of the TEC Pantheon. Left panel = Unseen/Abstract (Entropy, Kaznak). Right panel = Seen/Manifest (Lumina, EMC, Ferron, Cela). Clean, data-rich “Rosetta Stone.”

## Global Style & Canvas

- Aesthetic: Cinematic sacred horror, FLUX-realism, clean data viz.
- Canvas: A3 Vertical (4961×7016 px @ 300 DPI, PDF-ready).
- Palette: Deep Space Blue (#0B1E3B), Nexus Purple (#6A00F4), Digital Teal (#00D5C4), Cyber Gold (#F2C340), Onyx Black (#0A0A0C).
- Typography: Headers — Space Grotesk Semibold; Body — Inter Regular.
- Shared Negative: cartoonish, flat neon gradients, watermark, cluttered text, low-res.

## Overall Layout Prompt (Master Brief)

“Create a high-fidelity, two-column infographic. Left Column (The Unseen Frame): Titled ‘Entropy & Resonance,’ featuring the male Entropy avatar at the top and the female Kaznak avatar below. Right Column (The Seen Frame): Titled ‘The Manifest Forces,’ featuring four female avatars stacked: Lumina, EMC, Ferron, and Cela. A central, shimmering gravitational lensing seam violently divides the two columns, with light from the Right being warped and swallowed by the darkness of the Left. Each entity has a portrait, a sigil, key attributes, and their unique heterochromia callout. Background is a deep-space cathedral void with a glass floor showing interference patterns. Palette-locked, high-contrast, with clean zones for text labels.”

## Left Column: The Unseen Frame (Entropy & Resonance)

ENTITY 1: ENTROPY (THE AUDITOR)

- Portrait Prompt (≤512 chars): “Male cosmic auditor in a tailored Onyx cloak, a cracked hourglass sigil glowing faintly on his lapel; heterochromia (L silver, R void-violet). His presence causes background gradients to thin and decay. Sacred-horror minimalism, high-contrast, palette-locked.”
- Attributes:
  - Role: The Editor / Auditor of Reality
  - Domain: Time, Causality, Dissolution
  - Motto: “Unbounded axis; dwindling options.”
- Sigil Prompt: “Minimal vector sigil: a broken circle (hourglass) with a single notch pointing forward (arrow of time), enclosing an event-horizon dot. Monoline, duotone teal/violet.”

ENTITY 2: KAZNAK (THE HIDDEN HARMONY)

- Portrait Prompt (≤512 chars): “Regal resonance queen, onyx chitin plates with wet micro-speculars; a true-purple womb-core glows (red→gold→violet) through her torso; bioluminescent teal veins; triple orchid crown; heterochromia (L crimson, R electric blue). Sacred-horror realism, palette-locked.”
- Attributes:
  - Role: The Conductor / Resonance Incarnate
  - Domain: The Fifth Force, Substrate Conversion, Binding Harmony
  - Motto: “Inside the womb-core, gravity learns to speak.”
- Sigil Prompt: “Vector sigil: a gravity-lensed ellipse crossing a 6-node chemical lattice, with strokes suggesting the letters K-A-Z by pareidolia. Monoline, teal/violet.”

## Right Column: The Seen Frame (Manifest Forces)

ENTITY 3: LUMINA (LIGHT INCARNATE)

- Portrait Prompt (≤512 chars): “Luminous light goddess, glassy silicate skin lit by internal teal circuits; long, rainbow-spectrum hair as living light filaments; heterochromia (L gold, R green). Her aura reignites star-motes at the frame’s edge. Sacred-sublime realism, palette-locked.”
- Attributes:
  - Role: Mother of Photons / Information Carrier
  - Domain: Light, Information, The Visible Universe
  - Motto: “Endless reach, finite law.”
- Sigil Prompt: “Vector sun symbol (☉) with eight slender filaments; dual arcs (gold/green) on the outer ring for heterochromia. Monoline, duotone.”

ENTITY 4: EMC (THE FIELD WEAVER)

- Portrait Prompt (≤512 chars): “Sleek EM divinity in an ivory Faraday cloak with coil motifs; skin threaded with glowing teal circuits; an auroral mantle drifts from her shoulders; heterochromia (L teal, R violet). Fingertips emit coronal arcs. Sacred-tech realism, palette-locked.”
- Attributes:
  - Role: Signal-Sovereign / Weaver of Fields
  - Domain: Electromagnetism, Charge, Chemistry
  - Motto: “Every signal is a summons.”
- Sigil Prompt: “Vector coil halo (solenoid) with three clean magnetic field-line loops emerging. Monoline, duotone.”

ENTITY 5: FERRON (THE FORGE-HEART)

- Portrait Prompt (≤512 chars): “Nuclear forge-queen in armor of interlocking plates that resemble the dense, layered petals of a black iron blossom, glowing with a hematite sheen at the edges; heterochromia (L cyber-gold, R deep crimson); gauntlets emit brief quark-binding flares. Star-forge backdrop. Sacred-industrial realism, palette-locked.”
- Attributes:
  - Role: The Binder of Cores
  - Domain: Strong Nuclear Force, Matter, Stability
  - Motto: “Forge that holds the stars.”
- Sigil Prompt: “Vector tri-knot (three-leaf clover) bound by a tight hexagonal ring, symbolizing three quarks in a nucleon. Monoline, duotone.”

ENTITY 6: CELA (THE VEIL-RENDER)

- Portrait Prompt (≤512 chars): “Ghost-bright emissary of decay, veiled in translucent lilac light; heterochromia (L emerald, R ice-blue); neutrino streaks whisper past her form; her shawl is embroidered with beta-decay sigils. Sacred-elegy realism, palette-locked.”
- Attributes:
  - Role: The Alchemist of Change
  - Domain: Weak Nuclear Force, Decay, Transmutation
  - Motto: “Whisper that ends and begins.”
- Sigil Prompt: “Vector beta-decay arrow breaching a nucleus ring, with a small neutrino dash escaping. Monoline, duotone.”

## Footer & Assembly Notes

- Footer: Include palette swatches and a small “Convergence” icon to symbolize unity. Micro-copy: “Physics draws the lines; myth fills the color. Both point to the same horizon.”
- PDF Assembly:
  - Generate each of the six portraits and six sigils.
  - Use the Master Brief to create the overall background and layout.
  - In InDesign/Figma, place portraits and sigils into their columns.
  - Add text boxes for Attributes and Mottos next to each character.
  - Export as a high-resolution PDF.

Appendix: Canon Reference (v8.0 excerpt)

- TEC Pantheon Character Bible references for Entropy, Kaznak, Lumina, EMC, Ferron, Cela kept consistent with visual prompts above.
