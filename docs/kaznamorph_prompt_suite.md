# KaznaMorph Sovereign Prompt Suite (Sanitized, IP-Clean)

Date: [09,18,2025]
Author: AIRTH (Machine Goddess)

Objective: Provide multi-model prompt variants for the apex **True Entropic Absolute** entity without referencing external franchises or protected IP terms. All descriptors are original or generic.

## 1. Lore Capsule (Diegetic, Non-Explicit)

She is the terminal convergence of organized structure: a maternal architect that tends life only to orchestrate its graceful decay into ordered resonance. Every filament she emits is a timing signal; every chamber she inhabits becomes a synchronized field where entropy is *conducted*, not suffered. Her presence is not invasion—it is *the scheduled arrival of inevitability*.

Core Motifs:

* Sovereign Maternal Entropy
* Harmonized Dissolution (decay as music)
* Bioluminal Temporal Signaling
* Nested Reservoirs (life incubation → phase reclamation)
* Supra-sentient Strategic Patience

Brand Lexicon Tokens (use sparingly & consistently): `kaznaCore`, `poppiselFiber`, `ionSigil`, `resonanceHarmonic`, `entropyChoir`

## 2. Anatomical / Visual Trait Bank

Pick 6–10 per render; avoid using ALL simultaneously.

```
midnight-blue dermis with internal teal photons
laminated chitin-glass plates (smooth, non-splintered)
fiber-optic braided crown tendrils (poppiselFiber) emitting pulse gradients
fractal thoracic lattice with soft luminal reservoirs
ventral resonance nodules (breathing tempo light)
triptych sternum locus (shielded, non-gory, prismatic membrane)
orbital heterochromia (amber / ion teal) deep reflective glaze
subdermal filament veining (bioluminescent, slow wave)
plush larval attendant cradled at chest (non-threatening cover)
silken bio-sash semi-translucent over pelvic plating
precision talon digits (chrome-ceramic hybrid)
spore-mist dispersal ports along dorsal ridge
```

Environmental Anchors:

```
pristine incubation balcony
translucent egg array under ion mist
cathedral void with suspended luminal filaments
emerald accretion horizon projection panel
sterile chrome entropic observatory
```

Lighting Schemes:

```
amber key + cyan rim | ultraviolet subsurface bloom | teal pulse intervals | low volumetric haze | micro-specular humid sheen
```

Symbolism Layer (choose 1–2):

```
ritual of scheduled dissolution
maternal sovereignty before reclamation
silence before systemic phase change
the comfort of inevitable convergence
```

## 3. FLUX / SDXL Full Prompt (Hero Frame)

```
Pristine biomechanical sovereign entropy matriarch (kaznaCore), midnight-blue dermis with internal teal bioluminescent filaments, fiber-optic braided crown tendrils (poppiselFiber) pulsing in descending tempo, heterochromia eyes (amber and ion teal) reflective depth, triptych sternum locus veiled by plush larval attendant, calm maternal ominous gaze, standing forward on a ribbed chrome incubation balcony above a translucent egg array in teal spore-mist, cinematic sacred horror aesthetic, amber key light with cyan rim, subtle volumetric haze, micro-specular humid sheen, intricate subsurface scattering, high fidelity, depth of field, filmic grain subtle, theme of ritual of scheduled dissolution
```

Negative (FLUX/SDXL):

```
cartoon, anime lineart, low quality, blurry, watermark, text, signature, extra limbs, distorted anatomy, gore, harsh oversaturation, plastic skin
```

---

## 4. Tag-Model (Pony / Danbooru-Derived) Variant

```
score_9, rating_safe, solo, biomech sovereign matriarch, sacred horror, midnight-blue dermis, internal teal bioluminescence, fiber-optic crown tendrils, heterochromia eyes, plush larval attendant, incubation balcony, translucent egg array, teal spore mist, amber key light, cyan rim light, high fidelity, depth of field
```

Negative:

```
low quality, score_4, score_5, score_6, watermark, text, source_furry, source_cartoon, extra limbs, wrong anatomy, gore
```

---

## 5. Compact One-Liner (Batch Exploration)

```
solo biomech entropy sovereign (kaznaCore), midnight-blue dermis, internal teal glow filaments, fiber-optic crown, heterochromia amber/teal, incubation balcony over translucent eggs, cinematic sacred horror, amber key + cyan rim, high fidelity
```

---

## 6. Inpainting Micro Prompt (Face / Crown)

```
heterochromia eyes (amber/ion teal) reflective depth, refined fiber-optic braided crown tendrils, subtle bioluminescent tear duct glow, clean anatomical symmetry, high fidelity
```

---

## 7. Style Diversifiers (Swap Blocks)

Realistic Clean:

```
hyperreal clean surfaces, subdued contrast, soft diffused reflections
```

Gothic Luminous:

```
high contrast chiaroscuro, stained luminal arcs, cathedral void depth
```

Speculative Documentary:

```
clinical neutral color grading, sensor grain subtle, archival clarity
```

Use only one diversifier per run unless pursuing deliberate hybridization.

---

## 8. Sequence Prompting (Evolution Series)

Frame 1 (Emergence): `incipient resonance filaments unfurling, subdued glow`
Frame 2 (Stabilization): `synchronized pulse cadence establishing field`
Frame 3 (Dominion): `full harmonic lattice active, environment echoing pattern`
Frame 4 (Dissolution Prelude): `ambient structures softening at edges`

Add to end of base prompt for storyboard or animation conditioning.

---

## 9. Reinforcement Tokens & Future LoRA Plan

Designate rare tokens now for eventual lightweight fine-tune:

```
kaznaCore (core morphology)
poppiselFiber (crown filament signature)
entropyChoir (environmental resonance field style)
```

Keep usage consistent (one occurrence early) to seed embedding alignment later.

---

## 10. Safety / Hygiene

No gore descriptors. Use **plush** / **veiled** shielding language around anatomical focal points to maintain platform compliance and inclusive aesthetic.

---

## 11. CSV Logging Schema (Recommended)

```
seed,prompt,negative,sampler,steps,model,diversifier,tokens_core_used,notes
```

Automate later for reproducibility + RAG linking.

---

## 12. Next Steps

* (Option) Provide motivations / behavioral drives list → I will generate behavior-to-visual mapping tokens.
* Add LoRA trigger curriculum (image:prompt ratio, epoch sweep plan).
* Introduce resonance field overlay procedural mask guide.

Build. Validate. Commit. Ship.
