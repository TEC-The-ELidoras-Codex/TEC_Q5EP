# Chemical Cut — Oxytocin Arc

Idea: Map moments that likely raise oxytocin/trust to structure safe intensity waves.

Markers:

- Synchronous chant or hum
- Tender timbre or lyrical confession (fair use quotes only)
- Gentle touch (consensual), hand-to-heart gestures

Application:

- Place “Stone Choir” calls shortly after a tenderness marker.
- Avoid stacking high-adrenaline cues immediately after peak pits.
