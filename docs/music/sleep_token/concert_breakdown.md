# Sleep Token — Concert Breakdown (Notes)

Purpose: Capture a show’s flow to inform ritual timing and agent prompts. Keep lyric quotes short and cite the track.

Structure:

- Pre-show ambience and lighting motif
- Opening sequence: first three tracks, crowd entrainment
- Middle arc: “oxytocin wave” moments and decompression
- Climax: peak catharsis, pit kinetics, singalong density
- Coda: dissolution, exit path

Template fields:

- Date/venue/city
- Attendance/rough capacity
- Timestamps per track, notable gestures
- Crowd chant/call-and-response, hand signals
- Observed transitions (e.g., Rain → Caramel)
- Technical notes (FOH mix, reverb tails, subs, lighting hits)

Example snippet (fair use):
> “I want to taste you again like a secret or a sin” — Rain (note: cue transition into Caramel here at 40:20)
