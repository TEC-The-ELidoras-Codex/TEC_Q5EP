# Rain → Caramel — Meta-Map

Phenomenon: Emotional modulation moving from the longing of “Rain” into the surrender of “Caramel.” Use as a cue for closing gestures.

Map:

- Rain 40:20 — inflection point; soften lights, encourage palms-up receiving.
- Transition — breath cue, collective inhale-exhale (2 cycles).
- Caramel entrance — hands to heart, small forward nod; no phones.
