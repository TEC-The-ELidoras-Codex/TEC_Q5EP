# Red Rocks — Resonance Pack

Site specifics:

- Natural amphitheater; stone reflections produce long reverb tails. Mind the 200–400 Hz buildup.
- Wind: gusts across bowl can smear consonants; favor chest resonance on calls.
- Stomp cue: stone steps amplify; limit to 2 beats to avoid boomy wash.

Cues:

- Pre-show: humming in thirds; keep under 70 dB.
- Peak: during “The Summoning” breakdown, palms-up wave (no lights).
- Coda: single sustained “Ah” on exit through south stairs.
