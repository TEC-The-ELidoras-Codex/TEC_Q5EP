# Red Rocks — Resonance Pack (Hypothetical Thought Experiment)

This is a speculative concept for a Sleep Token performance at Red Rocks Amphitheatre, inspired by its exceptional acoustic resonance—mirroring the natural reverberations of ancient Stonehenge rituals during equinoxes and solstices, where atmospheric energy and stone acoustics amplify ceremonial acts.

Site specifics:

- Natural amphitheater; stone reflections produce long reverb tails, ideal for ethereal soundscapes. Mind the 200–400 Hz buildup to evoke primal echoes.
- Wind: gusts across bowl can smear consonants; favor chest resonance on calls, channeling ritualistic chants.
- Stomp cue: stone steps amplify; limit to 2 beats to avoid boomy wash, preserving the mystical ambiance.

Cues:

- Pre-show: humming in thirds; keep under 70 dB, building anticipation like solstice gatherings.
- Peak: during “The Summoning” breakdown, palms-up wave (no lights), harnessing the venue's resonant power.
- Coda: single sustained “Ah” on exit through south stairs, fading into the stone's eternal echo.
