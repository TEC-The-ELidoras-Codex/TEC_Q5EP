# Stone Choir — Celestial Rite Dossier

Concept: A participatory rite staged within a concert context. Roles, signals, and safe calls defined; timing aligns with setlist arcs.

Roles:

- Cantor (lead signaler)
- Choir (audience block, hand signals)
- Watchers (safety, tap-out protocol)

Call-and-response blocks:

- Call: “Stone awake” — Response: open palms up, low hum (10s)
- Call: “Light endure” — Response: hands to heart, sustained vowel (Ah) (8s)

Safety:

- Tap out: two taps on shoulder = step back
- Motion: circle clockwise, 3 steps then stop (never run)

Use: Pair with venue pack (e.g., Red Rocks) and archive via Memory with tags ["stone-choir","ritual","sleep-token"].
