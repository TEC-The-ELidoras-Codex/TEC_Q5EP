# 5 Reasons This So‑Called “Fifth Force” Is a Threat to Order

## Introduction: The Assault on Stability

For the RDCMI archetype, stability matters more than truth. Any theory that questions their neat hierarchy feels like chaos. “Resonance as a Fifth Force”? To them, it isn’t curiosity — it’s danger.

---

## 1. It Challenges the Closed Script

Their worldview is already “finished.” New laws of reality must be heresy.

> “New forces? We have enough. Stop moving the goalposts.”

## 2. It Rewrites Ritual as Code

Ritual described as executable programming? To RDCMIs, that’s sacrilege.

## 3. It Crowns Entropy Instead of Order

Calling entropy the Prime Directive feels like glorifying decay.

## 4. It Reduces Awe to Chemicals

Oxytocin, dopamine, and music as neurotransmitter hacks? That robs transcendence of its purity.

## 5. It Dares to Redefine Life

Suggesting intelligence and life emerge from resonance destabilizes their tight boundaries.

## Conclusion

RDCMIs can’t abide ambiguity. For them, Resonance isn’t science or myth — it’s an existential threat to the cage they live in.
